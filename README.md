# Lightning Model Lab

This is an independent Python project for verified dataset releases, detector
training, evaluation, and ONNX export. It deliberately does not depend on or
import `lightning_extractor`. Its stable input is source-grouped, human-verified
COCO JSON; the video CLI is only one possible producer of suitable images.

## Environment

```bash
cd lightning-strike-model-lab
uv sync --extra train --extra dev
```

The product CLI does not need to be installed in this environment.

## Importing CLI frame handoffs

The video-analysis repository exports neutral frames and provenance only. Import
that directory here to create an annotation campaign:

```bash
uv run lightning-model import-handoff ../frame-export \
  --output campaigns/storm-2026-08
```

The importer validates schema, safe paths, image decoding, duplicate hashes and
SHA-256 checksums. It publishes annotator tasks, a label configuration, served
images and a campaign manifest atomically. Annotation and conversion into the
model lab's internal dataset format happen entirely in this repository.

## Pipeline

```bash
uv run lightning-model release ../verified-dataset \
  --release-id lightning-2026.08.1 --output releases/lightning-2026.08.1

uv run lightning-model train releases/lightning-2026.08.1 \
  --output experiments/baseline --epochs 10

uv run lightning-model evaluate releases/lightning-2026.08.1 \
  experiments/baseline/checkpoint.pt \
  --output experiments/baseline/validation.json

uv run lightning-model export-onnx experiments/baseline/checkpoint.pt \
  --training-report experiments/baseline/training.json \
  --evaluation-report experiments/baseline/validation.json \
  --version 0.1.0 --output releases/model-0.1.0
```

Dataset releases reject unverified annotations, source leakage, conflicting
boxes for identical image hashes, unsafe paths, and overwrites. ONNX export
checks the graph and compares its outputs with PyTorch before publishing the
model bundle.

The generated `model.onnx`, `manifest.json`, and `checksums.json` form the only
contract consumed by the product runtime. Training checkpoints are never part
of the product distribution.
